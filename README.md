<h1>JetBrains Git - IntelliJ IDEA Git Graph, Commit & Shelf for VS Code</h1>

The most complete **IntelliJ IDEA / JetBrains Git** experience for **VS Code** and **Cursor**. Includes Git graph visualization, IDEA-style commit panel with shelf and stash, branch management with context menus, cherry-pick, rebase, merge, and 3-way merge editor. Works like WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, and Rider's Git tooling.

> Fork of [aotemj/jetbrains-git-graph](https://github.com/aotemj/jetbrains-git-graph), which is a fork of [zhyc9de/jet-git](https://github.com/zhyc9de/jet-git), with full IntelliJ IDEA-style context menus and UI enhancements.
